I am an electrical engineer with more that 20 years experience in
the energy supply and consulting environment.

My passion for Python development have set me down a slow but 
steady path to become a self employed full stack developer.

Most of my clients are in the engineering space although 
my largest project is an international trade application 
that is used by companies and government agencies 
around the world.

I help my clients automate the engineering tasks of:
* Data acquisition
* Data analysis
* Automated reporting in many different formats
* Tailored web applications and BI application

Below is a listing of some of the interesting work have been doing with my clients.
Almost all of the solutions have been implemented using Python.
