![porfolio](assets/about-me.PNG)
I am an electrical engineer with more that 20 years experience within the energy supply and consulting environment.
My passion for Python development have set me down a very slow but steady path to where I find myself today as a freelance full stack developer.

Most of my clients are in the engineering space although my largest project is an internantional trade application that is used by many 
companies and government agencies around the world.



> I really do figure out how to do, analyse and automate the things that is not obvious and documented.
